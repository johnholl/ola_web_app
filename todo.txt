REDUX ==> FIREBASE
X Visibility of pop ups (form and preview) should stay in redux
X place list should be obtained from a firebase call in the Map component
X placeforpreview can stay in redux
X Form component should push to firebase instead of update redux


OTHER TODOS FOR APP
* Form needs an upload for image to firebase storage
* Limit attempts
* Create Login, duplicate map component
* align numbers

HOSTING
* Firebase hosting?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DUPLICATE MAP / PUBLIC PRIVATE PLACES
* ola team will have their own admin URL
* it will be behind a firebase auth Login
* Each folder (Form, Map, Preview) will be duplicated, with necessary changes to each
    - map shows all places, not just public
    - preview allows toggle public / private
    - preview allows field editing
    - some kind of filtering / finding mechanism

LIMIT ATTEMPTS
* On submitting form, call a firebase function. that function will
    - log requesting IP address
    - check if IP has multiple (3) failed attempts in last hour
    - check key against list in firestore
    - if it fails, add 1 to failure key in IPs document if it exists, otherwise create it
* Also make a cleanup function that clears IPs at the top of every hour
