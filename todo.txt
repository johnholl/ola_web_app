REDUX ==> FIREBASE
X Visibility of pop ups (form and preview) should stay in redux
X place list should be obtained from a firebase call in the Map component
X placeforpreview can stay in redux
X Form component should push to firebase instead of update redux


OTHER TODOS FOR APP
X Form needs an upload for image to firebase storage
X Limit attempts
X Create Login, duplicate map component
X align numbers

HOSTING
* Firebase hosting?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DUPLICATE MAP / PUBLIC PRIVATE PLACES
* ola team will have their own admin URL X
* it will be behind a firebase auth Login X
* Each folder (Form, Map, Preview) will be duplicated, with necessary changes to each
    X map shows all places, not just public 
    X preview allows toggle public / private
    - preview allows field editing

LIMIT ATTEMPTS
X On submitting form, call a firebase function. that function will
    X log requesting IP address
    X check if IP has multiple (3) failed attempts in last hour
    X check key against list in firestore
    X if it fails, add 1 to failure key in IPs document if it exists, otherwise create it
X Also make a cleanup function that clears IPs at the top of every hour
